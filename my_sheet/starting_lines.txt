#### 💡 When starting to speak:

* “That’s an interesting question.”
* “Well, to begin with…”
* “Actually, I’d like to share my thoughts on this.”
* “Let me put it this way…”

#### 💡 When reacting to something I say:

* “Oh, I see what you mean.”
* “That makes sense.”
* “Exactly, I agree with that.”
* “That’s a good point.”

#### 💡 When you need a little time to think:

* “Let me think for a second…”
* “That’s a tough one, but I’ll try.”
* “I need a moment to organize my thoughts.”
